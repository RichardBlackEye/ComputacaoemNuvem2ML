# ComputacaoemNuvem2ML

# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage

1. It is required that the user creates a bucket in storage named "germl".

1.1. Upload to the "germl" bucket the file "ml_model_dataproc.py" found under folder "Python_File".

2. It is required that the user creates the dataproc cluster. It can be done using the following command:

gcloud dataproc clusters create mlwdi --region us-central1 --bucket germl --master-machine-type n1-standard-2 --worker-machine-type n1-standard-2

3. After pushing the docker image of the ComputacaoemNuvem2ML application and deploying it, we should insert the following REST program in the POST body:

{
  "projectId": "cloudcomputworlddevelopment",
  "job": {
    "placement": {
      "clusterName": "mlwdi"
    },
    "statusHistory": [],
    "reference": {
      "jobId": "germl_job",
      "projectId": "cloudcomputworlddevelopment"
    },
    "pysparkJob": {
      "mainPythonFileUri": "gs://germl/ml_model_dataproc.py",
      "properties": {},
      "jarFileUris": [
        "gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-latest.jar"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Following indications are from the
SWAGGER READ ME FILE:

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/cloudcomputworlddevelopment/regions/us-central1/jobs:submit//ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/cloudcomputworlddevelopment/regions/us-central1/jobs:submit//swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
